# Suggested Functionality (Potential Epics)

Following are suggested functionality for a practice guide application:

-   User can track their goals and practice session objectives, so that they can share with others.

-   User generates suggested list of exercises based from practice session objectives,
    so they don't have to figure out on their own.
    Each exercise has one or more learning assets the user can use to learn or practice.

-   User can access and use the exercise assets during the practice session.
    Assets may be external and managed/owned by another entity (where linking out to separate browser tab).
    **Note the SSO integration is out-of-scope for extenal managed resources, and dependent on external managed
    user session.**

-   User can record video and audio during their practice session,
    using a host machine camera and audio device (may require host machine audio routing to capture aggregate tracks).

-   User can publish video and audio of their practice session, and share with others.

-   User can save the status of their practice session, and share with others.

-   User can track progress towards goals.

-   App can be embedded into a Learning Management System (LMS) as a "Hands-on" exercise
    extension to a lesson.
